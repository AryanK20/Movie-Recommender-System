# Movie-Recommender-System

Project Overview
The Movie Recommender System is a machine learning-based web application that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. The system uses collaborative filtering techniques to generate recommendations, helping users find movies they may enjoy. The project is built using Python libraries for machine learning, Flask for the frontend, and development was done using Jupyter Notebook and PyCharm.

Features
Personalized Movie Recommendations: Suggests movies based on user preferences using collaborative filtering.
User-Based and Item-Based Filtering: Offers recommendations based on similarities between users and movies.
Responsive Web Interface: Built using Flask, allowing users to interact with the recommender system through a simple web interface.
Efficient Data Handling: Utilizes machine learning models to efficiently handle and recommend from large movie datasets.
Technologies and Tools Used
  Programming Languages: Python
Libraries/Frameworks:
  scikit-learn: For building the recommendation model (collaborative filtering, cosine similarity, etc.).
  Flask: Backend framework to build and run the web application.
  Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
  Pickle: Saving and loading trained models.
Development Environment:
  Jupyter Notebook: Used for model development, data preprocessing, and experiments.
  PyCharm: Used for integrating the model into the Flask application and organizing the project structure.
